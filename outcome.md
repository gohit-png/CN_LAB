# Configuring IP address to Routers in Packet Tracer and exploring Ping Responses

* A toplogy was created using Router-PT and two PC's connected to the router using copper cross-over connections
* Different default gateways were configured for both the PC's .
* A unique IP address was configured for each PC.
* IP adrres was configured for interfaces fa0/0 and fa1/0 using CLI
* PC1 was pinged from PC0 using the command prompt
* A simple PDU was stimulated by sending ICMP packet from PC0 to PC1

# Learning Outcomes

* Creating a topology using router as a connecting device.
* Configuring default gateway and ip address.
* Configuring ip address for the interfaces
* Checking if the destination is live using ping messages
* Simulation of sending a simple PDU from source to destination
* The device sets TTL in the packet header
